Early morning because my daughter woke me up.. some coffee and I should be good.

Had a dream that me and some friends were going to run a race in Stockholm. I think it was Stockholm Marathon, but might have been LidingÃ¶loppet (though we were not on LidingÃ¶..).

I was very excited and there were a lot of events and people. We were discussing which hotel to stay at. I wanted something with a great view.

We walked in during a university class where they were showing a magic pen which could copy the color you pointed it at. Voice command also worked. Amazing..? ðŸ™ˆ

In the end it turns out the race was cancelled, or some of the starting groups at least. So.. we headed back home. What a disappointment!
