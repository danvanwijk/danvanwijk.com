Friday again! It's been raining a lot tonight so pretty much all snow is gone. Sandbox outside is more like a pool now.

Vague memories of my dreams - it was set in what felt like the '60s or '70s. I remember an aerial passing of the harbour in Malmö, where Kockums was still operating and workers lingering everywhere. A huge industrial building with blue roof (workers on the roof as well..). I know I've seen this building somewhere but definitely not in Malmö.

There was also an award show of kinds. Don't know for what but someone was happy for receiving and award.

My wife found an old yellow phone that, in the dream, I said "oh I remember this one!".

There was an underlying presence of suspense the whole time. Can't put my finger on it but it felt like a thriller movie.
