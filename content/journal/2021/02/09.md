10k run to start the day. Quite windy in places but overall good feeling. [https://www.strava.com/activities/4758295762](https://www.strava.com/activities/4758295762 "https://www.strava.com/activities/4758295762")

I have a great thing to tell. Today my wife quit her job and signed an agreement to work with me instead! ðŸ˜€ She will start in June and will do  bookkeeping and project management. We're both very excited and look forward to the summer! ðŸ¥³
