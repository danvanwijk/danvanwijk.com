Had a weird dream that my parents turned a part of the street before their house into a festival area. They live on the countryside kind of isolated - so really not the place for these things ðŸ˜„

Anyway there was icecream, candy and flying tools - yes! I believe it was an oversized grinding machine - perfect for areas you can't reach. One of these tools broke because someone played with it too much. So yeah... ðŸ™ˆ
