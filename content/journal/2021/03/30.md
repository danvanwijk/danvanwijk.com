I managed to get up before 6! I remembered I wanted to do a morning run so I set an alarm for 5:30.. but I woke up before that. Hopefully I'm in sync with summer time now ðŸ™ˆ

Ran twice today, this morning and later this afternoon. Last one was not planned but it was such nice weather that I just had to ðŸ˜€ Overall ok feeling.
