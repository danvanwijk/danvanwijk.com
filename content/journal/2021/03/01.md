Looks like we're starting off the month and week with sunny weather. ðŸ˜€

I installed the macOS update this morning. Something went wrong though and my screen went black. Oh noes..! Restarted but it booted into recovery mode. More oh noes! Another restart, still recovery mode. This time I proceeded and got a message that the wrong version of macOS appeared to be installed. Googled the message and..  0 results ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜¬

Crap.

Looked like the only option I had was to reinstall the OS, so that's what I did. After 30 mins or so it successfully booted after restarting! And all my data was still intact. Luckily I didn't wipe the disk - which I usually do.

Interesting start of the week.. ðŸ™ˆ
