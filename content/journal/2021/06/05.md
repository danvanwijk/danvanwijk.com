Just before waking up I had a dream where I had a loose tooth. I was holding it a bit outside my mouth since it was stuck by a thread. It was huge! I would say one fourth of my palm. After a few unsuccessful pulls the thread finally snapped. When looking at the tooth I saw things stuck in it. Like plastic things.. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ™Š

Beautiful day. I've done some work today but still got to enjoy the sun. Had a nice lunch walk with ice cream. In the evening I took Moa for a bike ride and we made some stops at playgrounds.
