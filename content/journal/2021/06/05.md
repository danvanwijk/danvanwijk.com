Just before waking up I had a dream where I had a loose tooth. I was holding it a bit outside my mouth since it was stuck by a thread. It was huge! I would say one fourth of my palm. After a few unsuccessful pulls the thread finally snapped. When looking at the tooth I saw things stuck in it. Like plastic things.. ğŸ˜¬ğŸ™Š
