I gave Google Tasks another shot for about two days. Something about it annoys me though! I don't want to use it. Gave up and sticking with Things. It's the only app that has felt meticulously polished to me. You can tell Cultured Code has been at it for a long time.

I have no reason to change.. it's just my endless curiosity of productivity apps and pursuit of the perfect setup. I guess it's also a way to procrastinate things. "Gotta improve my setup before I can do this.." ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Note to self: Stick with Things and Bear now - at least for the rest of the year üôà. They are awesome apps and have flawless sync across devices. Their watchOS apps are great!

On another note, I'll start with my old habit of clearing out 5 of my things every week. I did this around two years ago and it was a nice way to get rid of excess things. Depending on the condition I will either throw it away, donate/recycle it or sell it. Let's see how it goes!
