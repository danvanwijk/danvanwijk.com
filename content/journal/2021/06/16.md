Beautiful morning! ☀️

Perfect 10k morning run. 10 degrees, no wind and sunny. Mmmm

Battled with a bug that took all day to track down! You know when you're looking at the same code over and over and the logic looks correct - from all angles - but what you get is not what you see. Well in this case the logic was correct, the bug was elsewhere in the chain.. 🤦‍♂️
