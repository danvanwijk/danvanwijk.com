Oliver woke up just 10 minutes after me. I was chocked! ðŸ˜® He normally sleeps to 11-12 AM now. I had to ask if he even went to bed.. ðŸ˜„ (he did). I took a photo of him and now it's also documented here. Historic day.

Good work day! It's felt like Friday the whole day. Probably because Moa is off starting tomorrow.
