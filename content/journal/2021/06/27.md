Good night's sleep! My body has recovered some during the night, mostly my knees that hurt a bit now.

Re: my weekly goal of getting rid of things, here are the 5 items for this week:
1. Old ripped pants.
2. Old ripped jeans.
3. Old and too big pyjamas shorts.
4. Old worn out Adidas Ultraboost shoes.
5. A can of AdBlue fluid. Filled up the car with what was left.
