Happy birthday to me 🥳

Started the day with a nice breakfast after a 10k run. My presents were sports drink powder and two smaller 250ml soft bottles. The ones I have now are 500ml so not optimal for bringing along without a vest or bag. Perfect 🎁!

They opened up Covid vaccination for my age group this evening so I booked a time next weekend.

Good day!
