Had another dream about a loose tooth that I ripped out. Nasty ðŸ™Š I was also talking to my old boss Magnus about an apartment I had bought but didn't know what to do with. Sounds like a luxurious problem, not one I have ðŸ˜„

Might head out for a 50k run tomorrow. Depends on how windy it is. Forecast is so-so..

Have a nice weekend!
