Another 10k morning run to start the day clear minded.

So Johanna started today and it was an exciting first day. Fun to have her there and looking forward to what we can achieve together! To be continued..!

I finished [Greenlights](https://www.danvanwijk.com/currently-listening-to-greenlights/) this evening. Enjoyed the book! Definitely not a dull performance by Matthew. I realized I've not seen that many of his movies, at least the older ones, perhaps I should. The romantic ones I might skip hehe.

Johanna working with me now is definitely a greenlight. I'm sure the first of more in this chapter.
