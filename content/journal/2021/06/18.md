Weird dream. I was running and at some point someone noticed I had two different shoes on, which I didn't have when I started of course. After the race there was a gathering and I kept looking for my shoes but could never find them.

A second path in the plot was about a murderer. We were a group that was about to get a shot. It was something harmless, at least in small doses. One person started to inject himself with a bunch of shots and got crazy. I don't remember all the details but he ran away. I think he was the reason my older brother later hid in a ventilation shaft.

There was more to this that I remember somewhat but the pieces feel so out of place and a bit hard to connect. My first thought when waking up was just "that was weird" 😄

Such a beautiful day! Very warm though ☀️☀️ Left work early to hang out at our community garden with Johanna. No children today (long time since that happened..) so we'll just relax and enjoy!
