Early morning today! Woke up at 3:40 and started preparing for my 50k run. After some coffee and Huel I set off at 4:30. Decided to keep a pace of around 5:30/km. It was okay temperature and cloudy. As usual I felt worn around the 30k mark so switched to a slower pace. The last 10k was also warmer because the clouds decided to break up ðŸ˜…

While I couldn't keep my goal pace throughout I still managed my second goal of completing in under 5h! Ended up with 4:48h so I'm happy with that.

After two pizzas I fell asleep on the couch! So worn out haha.
