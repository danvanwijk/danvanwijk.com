Intense dreaming towards the end of my sleep. I remember being on vacation with a group of people but not sure who they were. We were going up in the mountains. I was amazed when I saw our final destination from a bird's eye perspective. It was two separate, gigantic and beautiful buildings. One of them was next to a lake. They were modern and luxurious looking. Unfortunately my dream ended before reaching it but if that place is real I want to go there!
