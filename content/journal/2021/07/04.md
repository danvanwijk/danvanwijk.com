I was a bit tired yesterday but woke up feeling pretty much as usual. However around noon I started feeling tired again. Thinking about it I'm pretty sure it's not related to the shot, rather pollen allergy. It feels exactly the same. Grass pollen is very high right now so that's my suspect.

Reporting on this week's 5 items:

1. Worn out underwear.
2. A broken stick (ehm.. why did I even have this again?).
3. Old phone case (Johanna's).
4. Old, worn plastic folders.
5. Misc. small things from my "black box".
