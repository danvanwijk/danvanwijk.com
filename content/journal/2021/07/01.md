10k morning run. Went okay but felt some pain in my left leg. Didn't feel serious though. Perhaps a good thing that I won't run more this week since I'm getting vaccinated this weekend, in other words no physical activity..

July means second half of the year and the start of my next 1000 km - to complete my 2021 goal of 2000 km. I'm on track! 💪

Went to an outdoor pool with Moa this evening. Barely any people at all. It was not as cold in the water as I had imagined 👍
