Beautiful and calm morning!

Drove to a carwash after dropping off Moa at school. It is one of those with booths where you wash yourself using their pressure washer and stuff. You start it and pay using an app. Really smooth.

I just did a quick wash, mostly focusing on the dirty rims and bird 💩. Had a big one all over the the left backseat window. Nice..

Otherwise a good day's work with a nice lunch walk. Had an "Frozen"-Olaf ice cream. Moa doesn't want them so someone has to eat them.. 🙈🍦
