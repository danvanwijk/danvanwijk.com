Weird dream where I think I was part of some kind of mafia. At one time the boss asked me if I wanted to build muscle and get paid to be for show, basically. Haha no idea where this comes from. I have a slim figure and that is really not my area of interest. I was uncomfortable even in the dream ðŸ˜„

I had an idea that I should beat my half marathon PB this morning. First half was great but when I turned back there was strong wind. I continued for a while, grumbling over if I should keep up the pace or not. I changed my mind a few times but ultimately decided it wasn't worth it. I was feeling too worn out. Still a good run overall!
