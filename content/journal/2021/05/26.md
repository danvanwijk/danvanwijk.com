Started the day with a wet 10k run. I had shorts and some parts were on a dirt road so my legs were kind of dirty when done!

Ordered some small/medium sized whiteboards for the office. They should arrive sometime next week. Will be nice to be able to doodle down thoughts and stuff. Sometimes it's just easier to think when drawing and writing big.. or something ðŸ˜€

Not the best night's sleep so feeling a bit tired. Johanna tells me I sometimes sleep with my arm up in the air. Weird. I have no recollection of it but can usually tell because my watch tells me I've been standing. Funny thing is that I have the watch on my left wrist but according to Johanna it's the right arm I'm holding up.
