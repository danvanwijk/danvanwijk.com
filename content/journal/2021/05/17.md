New week, new opportunities! Ordered a new batch of Huel today. A mix of flavours of Hot & Savoury. Love it as a good lunch! Noticed they have a new good-looking shaker bottle.. funny how you can want a plastic bottle ðŸ˜… I was close to ordering it but kept my cool and decided to postpone it to my next order, or at least reconsider the decision then.
