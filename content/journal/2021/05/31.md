Last day of March!

I've been battling with issues related to running some containerized services with Docker on my M1 MacBook Pro. Most of it worked without changes thanks to existing multi-arch images and software but had some bumps with Puppeteer. Ended up installing chromium via apt instead of relying on puppeteer to handle it. Got it working at least.

Oh and mysql didn't work since it's amd64 only. Switched to mysql-server image from Oracle instead. Seems to be more or less a drop-in replacement.
