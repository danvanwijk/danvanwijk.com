Amazing day spent mostly outside. Me and Moa lingered outside in the morning before heading to the office for a while. After that we went to our community garden. The pool was actually not nice at all.. super cold ðŸ˜„

Went for a 10k run before Mother's day pizza (nice!). Much better feeling than yesterday!

Note to self: Stop making simple things into bigger issues that needs solving. You can make better use of your time.
