10k morning run. Much cooler today and good feeling throughout the run. Grabbed another local legend spot.

I've been putting together some new furniture in the office. A conference table and chairs, coat hanger and side table for the coffee machines (a Nespresso and Moccamaster Cup One). Looks good!

When I got home around 4PM we heard what sounded like a fire alarm. I went to investigate and found the source, there was smoke in our bicycle room. I didn't see any flames so weren't sure where the smoke came from. I went outside and called the emergency services.

A few minutes later a neighbor came with a fire extinguisher and told me the source was a pile of leaves. He said someone had probably lit them on fire and that the same thing happened yesterday. I obviously hadn't noticed anything yesterday.

Well, both firefighters and the police came. I got interrogated and they told me they will file a report since this was the second time.

Luckily there was no danger and no one got hurt.

An eventful Thursday...
