Reading about some of the updates Google are presenting today I got curious to try Google Tasks again. Still very plain and not at all as polished as Things in my view. If the new "smart canvas" thing for Workspace is any good I might still use it just for the tight integrations between products. We'll see..

Also downloaded Keep just to check and found my journal entries from last year, among other things. Some weird dreams I've written about there ðŸ˜„ I probably sleep better now because I usually struggle to remember my dreams.

Moa was playing with some paper full of glitter. It sticks everywhere! ðŸ˜¬ She had them in our bed and all over the couch. Brrr, not a fan of glitter
