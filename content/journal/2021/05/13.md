There is something eerie about being outside an early morning when it's a national holiday - it is so empty ğŸ™ˆ I once cycled on a main street in MalmÃ¶ on a similar day and I've never seen the city so empty. It was 1km of emptiness. Creepy but fascinating.

Anyway, it was a nice 10k morning run ğŸ˜€
