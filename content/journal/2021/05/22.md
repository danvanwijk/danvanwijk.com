Had a fairly good night's sleep 👍 and I did fell asleep on the couch, but not for long. Dragged myself to bed instead 😄

Today I've done some preparations for June 1st, when Johanna will start working with me. Trying out Notion to keep most things organized. Really looking forward to it! 😀

Tomorrow I'll head out for a half marathon to complete my weekly goal.
