Had a dream where I was preparing to run a race. It looked like a really big event. I was hanging out indoors in the race area when a person approached me asking if I wanted a sponsor. Wow sounds great - which company is it? What do they do? Can I see their logo? I have to be able to stand for who they are and what they do. What he showed me was not pretty.. ðŸ˜„ðŸ™ˆ

I don't remember the name but it was weird, at least 3 words, and the logo looked like a kid's drawing. The dream started to fade around here so unfortunately I can't say what the company actually did..
