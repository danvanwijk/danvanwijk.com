Friday and nice weather! ðŸ˜€

Picked up Moa earlier from school so Johanna could take her to an outdoor pool that just opened for the season. She loves going there ðŸ˜Š I had to do some more work so couldn't join, but we might go again tomorrow. Weather is going to be even better.

Now I'll enjoy the rest of the evening doing as little as possible :lazy:
