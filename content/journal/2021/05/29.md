I forced myself to stay in bed and sleep more after waking up before 5. Got an hour more at least ğŸ™ˆ

I've spent hours outside with Moa today. Mostly sunny and warm, it's been great! I've had two ice creams.. ğŸ¤«ğŸ˜€

Went out for a 10k run before dinner. Not a great feeling but probably due to the heat.

Tomorrow will be a sunny Mother's day. Johanna will get some sleep from working night shift then we'll head over to our ommunity garden and spend the rest of the day there. We just put up our small pool so we can cool down from the heat!
