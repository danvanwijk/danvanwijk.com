Slow progress with [Spacer, Smuggler, Pirate, Spy](https://www.danvanwijk.com/currently-listening-to-spacer-smuggler-pirate-spy/). Have just below 5 hours left. I don't know, the first book got me hooked but the second one hasn't. Not so far. I'll probably keep listening to the end anyway. Next on my list is Ready Player Two - I enjoyed the movie of the first book (haven't read it).
