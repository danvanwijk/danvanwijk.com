At least it's sunny..

I had planned a morning run but was short on time so either tonight or tomorrow.

It was a clear sky when I got home so decided to run. Beautiful sunset! [https://www.strava.com/activities/4624838701](https://www.strava.com/activities/4624838701 "https://www.strava.com/activities/4624838701")

Wish you all a great weekend!
