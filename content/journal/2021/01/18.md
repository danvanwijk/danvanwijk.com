Morning! New week ahead of us. Looks a bit warmer outside but still gray and potential rain later.

Finished [Spacer, Smuggler, Pirate, Spy](/currently-listening-to-spacer-smuggler-pirate-spy/) during lunch. Not the best books I've read but OK at least.

Briefly played with Next.js yesterday. That is, followed a tutorial on using it with together with AWS Amplify. I think Amplify looks neat but I've not built anything with a backend yet, just used it for static sites.

One of my thoughts when following the tutorial was that "_setting up AWS resources with just a single command is nice, but perhaps too much abstraction for my taste..?_" Coming from verbose CloudFormation templates to this? I don't know, maybe I just need to give it more time.
