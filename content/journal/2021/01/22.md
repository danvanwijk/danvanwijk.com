Happy Friday! An early one for me. Soon time for work!

Funny thing, I dropped off my daugher at school and when heading back I saw this plastic or carton lid just shooting forward along the ground at an angle. Probably at 20km/h (I drove at 30km/h). I know what you're thinking, some kind of supernatural phenomenon.. sorry to say it was just very windy! Gave me a smile ðŸ˜„

Have a great weekend!
