Been playing with Tailwind CSS and Hugo to create a new site. First time I'm using Tailwind actually..! It's nice. Also the first Hugo theme - well I'm not actually doing it as a theme but most of the logic is still the same. I think it's neat and have grown more fond of Hugo.

I'll share the site with you soon enough.. :)
