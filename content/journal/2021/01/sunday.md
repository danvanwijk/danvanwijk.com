I tried running with music today. First time in.. 9-10 years I think. Back in the days when running with RunKeeper on your iPhone strapped to your arm was new and exciting. I didn't like it then but it was OK today. Much easier with just an Apple Watch and AirPods. No cables or extra weight. I removed them halfway though, a bit unused to it and it is hard to beat silence and nature. We'll see if it happens again.. :)
