Merry Christmas! Hope you have a nice and safe Christmas.

I found the year totals function in Strava I was looking for the other day. Though only on the desktop website. Either way, total running distance for 2019 was ~1200 km. So an increase this year with 500 km. Not too bad.

10k morning run to welcome Christmas. [https://www.strava.com/activities/4510772464](https://www.strava.com/activities/4510772464)

Good last episode of Mirakel :)
