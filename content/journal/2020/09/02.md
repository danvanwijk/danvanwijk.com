Late entry today..!

Getting ready for the marathon. I've fixed my leaking Salomon bottles with the new soft valves I ordered last week. Like new! By the way, UPS in Sweden is so much worse than the other delivery firms. I always sigh when stuff I order is sent with them...

Anyways.. picking up sports drink from Umara tomorrow. New flavor of elder berry that I hope will go down well. Trying their salty bars as well.

Will be fun! :D
