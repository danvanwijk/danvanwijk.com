Taking my daughter to the dentist - it was a long time ago I went myself..

Apple event later today! Let's see what new stuff they have for us. Hoping the new versions of their OSes are released soon.

iPad Air looks nice! Currently have an Android tablet - nothing wrong with it at all, except that it's not running iPadOS ðŸ™ˆ

Happy to hear iOS 14 and watchOS 7 are released tomorrow!
