Tough marathon today! I set out with a goal time of *3:30:00*, previous best being *3:49:35* - so it was an amitious goal. I was feeling great and kept my target pace for kilometer after kilometer. Then, at 29-30k came *the wall*.. after that there wasn't much left to do but switching into lower gear and endure the last, painful (mostly mentally), kilometers.

I finished in **3:42:26** - so still a personal best! Happy with the run overall and glad I could keep my pace consistent.
