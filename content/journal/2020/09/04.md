Morning! Friday again.

I found a route for my marathon this weekend. It's mostly on known paths but some are new. I don't know the exact distance, doubt it's 42k, but long enough so I can run whatever is left close to home. Still haven't decided what day though but leaning towards tomorrow.

Decided to run tomorrow! I'll post a live track link in tomorrows entry if you want to follow.
