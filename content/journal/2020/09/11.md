Friday is here!

Wore my Apple Watch for the first time while sleeping yesterday. Not that much interesting data at the moment (not using 3rd party apps..), but now I'm curious about the sleep tracking feature in watchOS 7. Amazed that the battery was >40% when I woke up this morning - I'd been wearing it for ~24h!
