That day of the (new) week :)

I was supposed to run [Liding√∂loppet 30k](https://www.lidingoloppet.se/) in Stockholm on Saturday but they've changed it to a virtual race.
You can still run on the official course but I'm not keen on going there right now. I haven't decided if I'm going to run on Saturday or another day,
you can do it anytime until October 18. I'll keep you posted.
