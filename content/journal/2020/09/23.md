Waiting for macOS Big Sur to be released. A feature I'm particularly interested in is AirPods automatic device switching.
It's one thing I expected would just work when I bought them, but no. Soon I'm expecting there will be no more hassle when listening to music on the computer and receiving a phone call.

Such a beautiful sunny day today ðŸ˜Š
