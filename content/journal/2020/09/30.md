Got tempted to buy a [Stryd](https://www.stryd.com/) power meter to pair with my Apple Watch.
One thing I've noted when running with both my Apple Watch and Polar Vantage V is that the GPS accuracy of Apple Watch is really off.
I can't reliably run with it on it's own so pairing with a Stryd would give me accurate distance AND pace.
The pace is something my Vantage V struggles with and I'm not confident when looking at it during a run, which bothers me.

I can of course pair it with my Polar as well and get accurate pace - I might end up doing this. Though I would like to try it out with Apple Watch. Battery time might be an issue on longer runs though.

Either way, this also got me interested in having a closer look at the power meter already available in my Polar. I haven't looked at or used this data that much.
