New week! :)

Wow, looks like it's quite a warm day.

Slower 10k lunch run. ACR at 114%. [https://www.strava.com/activities/4275411248](https://www.strava.com/activities/4275411248 "https://www.strava.com/activities/4275411248")

Planning to do a \~17k run on Sunday. It was supposed to be a race but it was cancelled. Not sure if I'll try race pace or just do a regular training run.
