Upgraded to macOS Big Sur this morning. Instantly noticed that all text as blurry! In previous versions you could turn off `Use LCD font smoothing when available` to fix it but this option is removed in Big Sur. Luckily after some googling I found [https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html "TinkerTool") which has a setting for disabling font smoothing.

I like the new design and the now seamless connection of AirPods. Visual Studio Code has been acting a bit weird today though with occasional and short freezes. I haven't tried a full restart of the compuer yet but hoping it's just a temporary thing.
