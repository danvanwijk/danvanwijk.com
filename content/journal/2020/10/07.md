Morning! 🌧

Thinking about how attached I've become to my Apple Watch. It's not that I'm constantly using it (besides checking time),
just these small moments during the day where it's there for you. It has definitely created a need for me ⌚️

Polar unveiled a new version of their Vantage V watch today - Vantage V2. I haven't looked at the details yet, just peaked quickly at their live stream.
