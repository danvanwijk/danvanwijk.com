I think I'll run the virtual edition of Liding√∂loppet (30k) on Saturday. I postponed it a few weeks back since I got a cold.
This weekend is the last chance to run if you want to register an official result. Prepping for running Saturday morning.
Not sure what time to aim for yet but probably a pace close to 5:00/km.
