So I finally finished Cage of Souls! I must say I enjoyed it. Interesting characters and gripping places and environments.
I really liked the narrator and his ability to give different characters their unique personality.

Today it's official - I've started my own company! ðŸ¥³ This is the "thing" I was hinting about a while back. I'll provide more details later on. Stay tuned!
