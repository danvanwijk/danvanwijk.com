Started reading about Apple Watch GPS accuracy and found out you can [calibrate](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516) the watch! Need to try this. Hopefully it can solve the distance accuracy for me.

Also found a workout app that seems to be just what I've been looking for: [WorkOutDoors](http://www.workoutdoors.net/).
I've just started playing with it but the features and customization options it offers seems amazing!
