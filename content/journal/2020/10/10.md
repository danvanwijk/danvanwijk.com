Started reading about Apple Watch GPS accuracy and found out you can [calibrate](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516) the watch! Need to try this. Hopefully it can solve the distance accuracy for me.

Also found a workout app that seems to be just what I've been looking for: [WorkOutDoors](http://www.workoutdoors.net/).
I've just started playing with it but the features and customization options it offers seems amazing!

After doing calibration by both walking and running today I gave WorkOutDoors a try. I must say I really like it! I won't dive into any details yet, want to try it out more first. Pace is more accurate than my Vantage V though. As for the calibration - I think distance accuracy improved some. I'll do another calibration later in an even more open area to reduce potential issues.

So, a 4k calibration run then a 5k normal run. ACR at *103%*. Wow, back at 100% again..!
