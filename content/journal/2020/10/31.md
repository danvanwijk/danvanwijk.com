Trying out [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) to update this site for a little nicer CMS experience than the raw GitHub repo/editor. Let's see how it feels! Seems to work well on the phone as well.

Been a while since I talked about my analogue bullet journaling. It didn't really work out for me in the end as it felt too unnatural in my otherwise digital daily workflow. Right now I've settled with [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). Love the UI/UX.
