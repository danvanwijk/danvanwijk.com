Look at those suns..!

Beginning of this year I set a goal of running *2000 km* in 2020. That's a 100% increase since last year. Due to an injury in Q1 I'm a bit behind - but not by that much, just *133 km*. I've been cautiously increasing my weekly distance and aiming to complete the goal.

Beautiful, calm and chill-to-warm morning run. ACR after this run is at *119%*.
