I have a morning routine doing some stretching. Mostly focused around my legs but also doing push-ups. It's a nice way to start the day - gets the blood flowing!

Finished *The Little Book of Ikigai* audiobook. Definitely learned more about Japanese culture. It was okay.

Started listening to *Heist* (first episode).
