Spent the day at my parents place. Luckily they have a pool, which helped us endure the heat..

No running this weekend. After the last run my legs felt a bit worn out and I don't want to risk unnecessary injuries - so rest it is. Hoping it feels better tomorrow. If so I'll try to do a morning run when it's still decent temperature.

Back to work tomorrow.
