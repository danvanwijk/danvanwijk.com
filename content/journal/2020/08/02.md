Last day of vacation. Too bad it seems so cloudy.. oh well.

ACR is down to *90%* so should go for a run, we'll see.

Did my first [FitSpark](https://www.polar.com/en/smart-coaching/fit-spark) training. 10 min warm up, 35 min running in pulse zone 3, 5 min cool down. It felt odd to focus on pulse and I had some issues keeping a consistent pace as I'm not used to running this slow.

ACR went up to *103%* - good!
