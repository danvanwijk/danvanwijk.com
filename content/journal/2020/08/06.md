So the pizzas were true. We all made our own Naples-style pizzas, ate them, got served professionally made ones, ate them, then got served even more. A whole lot of super tasty pizzas :D

To make up for all that pizza I ran 21k this morning. No target pace in mind, just the distance. Very hot.. but felt good! ACR at 107%.
