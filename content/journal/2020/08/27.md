Good feeling on my 20k morning run today :) ACR at *113%*. Aiming for another 20k run this weekend, which will land me on 50k in total this week.

Ordered new [soft valves](https://www.salomon.com/sv-se/shop-emea/product/soft-valve.html#color=12993) for my Salomon bottles, which I've apparently bitten through.
