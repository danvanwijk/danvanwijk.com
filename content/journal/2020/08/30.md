Another clear, chilly and calm morning. Love sunrises like this!

Next weekend I'm running Stockholm Marathon Virtual Edition. I haven't decided day or target time but I'll get back on that. I'm thinking sub 3h 40min. My best estimated (i.e. not an official race) time so far is [~3h 49min](https://www.strava.com/activities/3711863942). I'm pretty sure if I just keep a more consistent pace it will not be an issue. I usually end up going faster the first 20k or so. Maybe I'll post my Strava Beacon link here so you can follow me :)
