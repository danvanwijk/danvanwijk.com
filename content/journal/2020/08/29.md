Very calm morning with no wind.

I will help install some flooring today. Bob the Builder to the rescue!

My bullet journaling is feeling more natural now and I enjoy and appreciate it. The notebook I'm using is [LEUCHTTURM1917 medium A5](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-5-3-4-x-8-1-4-in.html) with dotted pages. Solid and good looking.
