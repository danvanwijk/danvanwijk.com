Got access to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) beta yesterday. I've only just started using it but first impression is "love it!". Coding in the cloud is not new for me so I'm very used to the setup already. I've been using Cloud9 previously (before aquired by AWS) and right now I'm running VS Code (via [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)) on EC2. This journal entry is created, written and published using Codespaces :)

With Codespaces access I needed something to test with so I finally got around to pushing this site to GitHub.

Free trial of [mytrainingforecast.run](https://mytrainingforecast.run/) ran out today but I decided I need more time to test the tool. Will happily pay for services that gives me value.
