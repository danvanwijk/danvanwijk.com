Morning! Writing these entries from my phone now most of the times - makes things easier.

Not sure if a digital Bullet Journal is working out for me. I usually end up focusing more on the tools and technical aspects of things.. which is really not what I need. Just gets me to procrastinate more! Thinking of trying the real deal instead, i.e. going analogue.
