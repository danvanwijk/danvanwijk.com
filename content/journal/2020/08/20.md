I'll do some journal entries without weather screenshots now. Reason is simply that this process is very manual at the moment and it get's tedious. Better to focus on actually writing something :D

I had a nice morning run! Legs feel OK afterwards so that's a good sign. Ended up at 20k with some really nice views of Lund. ACR at *73%* now due to some days of rest.
