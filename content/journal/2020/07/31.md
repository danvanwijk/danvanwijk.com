Finally some sun! Hopefully.

Trying out [myTrainingForecast.run](https://myTrainingForecast.run) to help me train smarter and minimize risks of injury. Signed up for their 14 days free premium trial. My *ACR* looks good - should be between 80% - 130% so I'm in the low.

For my run I set out with the same goal as Wednesday, *21k* in *1h 40m*. Decided to cut the distance short due to some pain in my right foot. Good feeling otherwise with fairly consistent pace throughout.
