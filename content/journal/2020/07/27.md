So, entering the last week of my vacation and first journal entry. One goal I had for my vacation was to get this site up and running - check! I like the simplicity of it and that it's just a static, fast site. I intend to write a post about the setup.

I read the news about Super Mario 64 source code being leaked and that Luigi's character was found inside. "L is real 2401" - Luigi is real **24** years and **01** months (which is now!) since the game was released. Mind blown.. :O
