Hi there! I'm Dan van Wijk. I live in Lund, Sweden with my wife and two kids.

I love running and all aspecs of it. Being outside, getting exercise, exploring known or unknown areas and clearing the mind. I'm not looking to become an elite runner or anything, I just enjoy running. I'm happy with making slow and steady progress and improvements. I compete with myself in that regard.

I consider myself a minimalist in the sense that I don't want more than I need. This is something that has grown more obvious to me in later years, especially considering the impact our excessive consumption has on our planet.

More to come..
