>
> For more than 60 years, Caine has played thieves, criminals, gangsters and the detectives trying to catch them. But there’s Hollywood and then there’s real life... and that’s when things get really interesting.
>
> From the largest bank burglary in American history, to the world’s most audacious book heist, Heist with Michael Caine travels to America, Australia, Stockholm, Antwerp and everywhere in-between to tell true stories behind the world’s most daring heists.
