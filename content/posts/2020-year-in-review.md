We all know this year has been a very different one and I'm grateful that me and my family have managed to stay healthy. I started January by signing up for a lot of running races throughout the year - the most I've ever done in a year. The first race was in March but I didn't run since I had an injury in my leg. I had been training too much and didn't give my body enough rest. That was the first and only _real_ race that took place - every other race I had signed up for was cancelled or changed to a virtual one. Rightfully so, of course.

## Next chapter in life

I've been working from home since March except for occasional visits to the office. Being the only developer it was not a difficult change practically, so I'm thankful for that. While I miss the social aspect of being at the office I must say it has worked out good.

Working from home triggered a different mindset for me. It enabled me to do some changes to my lifestyle. Small and subtle perhaps but important mentally. For the first time I felt more in control of my time. So much actually that it pushed me to follow one of my dreams - starting and running a company.

This will be the next chapter in my life. I look forward to see where it takes me.

## Some other highlights

* I switched back to iOS after lingering in Camp Andorid for a while.
* I started reading (or listening to) books. The convenience of AirPods was the biggest trigger for this.
* I started this site! :)
* My daughter started school.
* 1700+ km total distance run.
* First 50 km (and 4 AM) run.
* Sub 1:35h half marathon.

I wish you all a **Happy New Year**! Stay healthy and safe - together we will get through this.
