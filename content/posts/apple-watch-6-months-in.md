If you missed my first post you can find it [here](https://www.danvanwijk.com/apple-watch-initial-thoughts/).

I've had my Apple Watch for close to 6 months now. I'm still very happy with it, even more so than before! I now wear it 24/7. So how has my usage of the watch changed in these months? Not drastically to be honest. Basically there are 3 areas to look into.

## Things

By this I mean _Things_, as in the app. This has replaced _Reminders_ as my daily driver for tasks. I started using it on Mac and iPhone a while back, so it's a natural extension to that. Mostly use it for marking tasks as done. I still use _Reminders_ for location-based tasks.

## Sleep tracking

Yes, with the release of watchOS 7 featuring sleep tracking I've now decided to replace my Polar Vantage V at night. I still think Polar offers better data overall, but the main thing I monitor is my pulse - which Apple delivers good enough. I also like having my data centrally in the Health app.

## Training

This one is the most surprising. I actually replaced my Polar watch, not only for sleep tracking but also for training! Did not see that coming. So yeah, I use my Apple Watch for everything.

The great app I use for running is [WorkOutDoors](http://www.workoutdoors.net/). At times, e.g. during races, I combine this with the Strava app to have live-tracking for friends and family who wants to follow me. Strava complains that I should not have another training app running at the same time but I've never experienced any issues. Both apps run perfectly fine together.

Those are the main changes. Still feels like there are some apps missing from watchOS. Can't say which ones, just a feeling I have. I'll aim to revisit this again in another 6 months time to see what has changed.
