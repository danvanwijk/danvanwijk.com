My main reason for buying an Apple Watch was to be able to leave my phone behind when going outside. In this aspect the watch is brilliant! When my phone is out of range the watch connects automatically to the cellular network and I'm able to take phone calls and texts. The speaker and mic are both good enough to have a decent quality conversation. With a little help from Siri I'm able to send texts easily and she usually transcribes correctly. I'm very happy with this functionality. Only complaint is that the battery drains fairly quickly when the watch is doing all this on it's own, without help from my phone.

## Apps
Besides *Phone* and *Messages* the apps I find myself using the most are:

### Weather
- Always good to have a forecast at hand.

### Reminders
- Love the ability to ask Siri to remind me about something when I get home or to add *toilet paper* to my *shopping list* when running low.

### Activity
- Good reminders about standing up hourly.
- I'm not hardcore about closing all rings every day but it does help to push extra sometimes.

### Calendar
- Good to have today's and coming days planned activities available.
- I would like to see further ahead than just a week. It's too narrow in my opinion and I'm not sure why there's a need for such limitation.

### Wallet
- Love this feature! No need to fiddle with your wallet, just a double-tap and hold the watch near the terminal. Awesome.

### Audible
- Since I bought AirPods I've started to listen to audiobooks. Having Audible on your watch with offline storage is great!

## Real-time location sharing

Another reason I got the Apple Watch is to share my runs in real-time with family and friends using [Strava Beacon](https://blog.strava.com/beacon/). I have a Polar Vantage V sports watch so I don't usually run with my phone. Now I have both watches when running so I can use Strava on Apple Watch to share my progress, i.e. during races.

## Happy so far
I'm happy with the watch so far. I thought there was going to be more apps I would want to use but I haven't found many that interest me. Perhaps watchOS 7 will bring some fun additions. I'm curious about the upcoming sleep tracking but not sure if I will use it either way. My Polar Vantage V already does a great job tracking my sleep.
