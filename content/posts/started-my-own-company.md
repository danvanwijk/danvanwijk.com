As I've mentioned very briefly in my journal, I've started my own company. 2021 will mark the beginning of my new venture and I'm super excited to get started!

## What will you do?
Basically the same as I'm doing right now, and have been for all these years - build and run websites and web applications. In other words, not really a major change of direction in terms of occupation or anything like that.

## Why?
I guess I can divide this into 4 different bullets.

**"Teenage Dream"**\
Since my teenage years, there has always been a desire to one day have my own company.

**Personal and Professional Development**\
I want to learn the workings of building and running a company. Bookkeeping, hiring, board meetings - all of it.

**Building a Lifestyle**\
I have a vision of building a company around the lifestyle I want, instead of forming a lifestyle around a "regular" job. A lot of one's time is spent with and at work. To me it's logical that because of this, what you do and how you do it should intertwine with the lifestyle you want.

**Things to Come**\
Later on I want to explore building my own products :)

## What's the name?

The legal name is `Wijk Works AB`. Website is (in Swedish) [wijk.works](https://wijk.works/) - kind of a domain hack :)

Time will tell where this will end up. There will probably be bumps along the way but I'm sure it will be an interesting and rewarding journey - in more than one way. Here's to 2021! :)
