> Welcome to the village of Stenhurst. Home to a butcher, baker and a terrorist cell, apparently. Sealed off from the world by sinister government agents, four teens discover that this official story is just that, a story. The truth behind the lockdown lies in a mysterious creature labelled CatX - and they will stop at nothing to locate her. Brilliantly performed by Raza Jaffrey, this thrilling Audible Original is the perfect listen for fans of Stranger Things.
