My main requirement for this site is that it must be static and easy to manage (i.e post new content). I ventured into the world of static site generators a few years back and the tool that stood out to me then was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In recent years, one that has become very popular is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). It's on my list of stuff to dig deeper into, because it definitely looks interesting. For my simple needs though, I felt Hugo was the perfect fit right now.

## Hugo
Without trailing into details about Hugo and how it works I'll describe how I've divided this site into 3 different content types - pages, posts and journal entries.
* **Pages** are regular pages such as About and Contact. These are rarely changed.
* **Posts** are pages such as this one you are reading now, touching a specific subject. I intend to add new posts regularly.
* **Journal** are pages I add daily, i.e journal entries. Just things that are on my mind. Some are longer, some are shorter. Many are related to running :)

You can see these different pages on [GitHub](https://github.com/danvanwijk/danvanwijk.com/tree/master/content).
