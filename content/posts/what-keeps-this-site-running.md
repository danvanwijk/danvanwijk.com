My main requirement for this site is that it must be static and easy to manage (i.e post new content). I ventured into the world of static site generators a few years back and the tool that stood out to me then was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In recent years, one that has become very popular is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). It's on my list of stuff to dig deeper into, because it definitely looks interesting. For my simple needs though, I felt Hugo was the perfect fit right now.
