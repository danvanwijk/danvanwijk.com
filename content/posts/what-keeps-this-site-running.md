My main requirement for this site was that it must be static and easy to manage (i.e post new content). I ventured into the world of static site generators a few years back and the tool that stood out to me then was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In recent years, one of the newcomers is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
